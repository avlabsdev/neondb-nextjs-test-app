# supabase-nextjs-test-app

I successfully setup Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Next.js.

Proof of database connection and showing data on page from a countries table: [https://supabase-nextjs-test-app.vercel.app/countries](https://supabase-nextjs-test-app.vercel.app/countries)

This is a simple proof of setup. I will be creating full apps from more extensive databases/tables shortly. Eventually, I will also include authentication and more.
